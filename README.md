# CNN's-Image-Classification-CATS-VS-DOGS

We will continue working on the image classification problem we started last week. Recall that our goal was to develop CNNs to classify images as "dogs" or "cats" in a dataset containing 4000 images of cats and dogs. We had 2000 images for training, 1000 for validation, and 1000 for testing.

First, add the `cats_dogs_small` folder from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11-2z9P45FtJJPm9LbipVMAnNZ36kMQUH) to your Google Drive. For example, you can drag and drop the `cats_dogs_small` folder into your "My Drive"; this will add a shortcut to the original folder in your "My Drive". By doing so, you can run your code directly on the data that are stored on my Google Drive account without the need to download the images and upload them to your Drive.
